# A sample delivery pipeline
This repository contains the codebase of example presented in a blog post at AutomatingGuy.com (Exploring Jenkins Pipelines - an example delivery flow).

The code here is a fully functional system, with a sample application, automated API and UI tests and necessary Dockerfiles and pipeline-as-code in form of a Jenkinsfile.
